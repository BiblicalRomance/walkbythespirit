Walk by the Spirit is a collection of articles published with the goal of helping people expect God to be real in their life.

God isn't focused on improving our life here on earth, nor helping us master an increasing skillset of rules and doctrines. A Christian is first and foremost a forgiven and redeemed creation, who has died to their old life and been adopted into the family of God. God has put his own Spirit inside us and our true purpose for existing begins.

God created us for a relationship. A relationship so complex and perfect that the best we can compare it too is a combination of the best parts of many others:

- Father - Son
- Husband - Wife
- King - Servant
- Friend

Walk by the Spirit was born from the teachings on [Biblical Romance](http://biblicalromance.com) and [1jn2](http://1jn2.com/bible).
