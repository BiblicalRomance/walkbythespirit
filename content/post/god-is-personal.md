At least, his goals always seem to be focused on a personal relationship with us. He isn't trying to collect more glory or make people understand how wise he is. God seems to be after our hearts and affections above our knowldge, obediance, or understanding.



God is not acting like a political leader, company CEO, or teacher. He's not trying to gain the platform, assuance, affulence, wealth, and other common primary goals of human leaders.

1. God died for you. How many people have loved you enough to die for you? Why? Couldn't God have picked another (less personally-sacraficial) way to save us?

2. Why did God die for you? Not just salvation from sins and hell. Jesus died because God wants us as his own children. God wants us as his family.

> For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. - 1 Thessalonians 5:9-10

> Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. - Hebrews 12:2

This "joy" was what? We wouldn't be guilty anymore? No. It is the wedding feast of the lamb. It is "emanuel", God with us.

3. Jesus wept three recorded times in the bible. What moved God's eternal word the most, was people. Jesus didn't cry when Jerusalem finally praised him at his triumpal entry, he didn't cry when people rejected him, he didn't cry when things were hard. Jesus heart went out for relationship with others - and the father.

> Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see. Jesus wept. Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! - John 11:32-36

> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! - Luke 13:34 (also LUKE 19:41â€“44)

> Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; - Hebrews 5:7

This last verse might be mistaken as Jesus crying from anguash at the physical pain he was about to endure. However, I think scripture makes the case that as bad as that was - God himself crushing (Isaiah 53:10) and forsaking (Matthew 27:46) Jesus was by far the worst part of Jesus death. Jesus, eternally with the father.

This example isn't even close, but how many of you with a great relationship with your father/mother/spouse are willing to have them reject and destroy you so that you can help someone who hates you and is litterally trying to kill you? That is crazy deep sacraficial love.

4. Everything glorifies God - but what is God's Glory? Moses asked God "shew me thy glory" (Exodus 33:18). God's reply explained what His glory was.

> And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin... - Exodus 34:6-7

So God's glory is his longsuffering, merciful, gracious, forgiving, truthful nature and desires. This is confirmed and repented multiple times in the old testament. Have you ever wondered where Jonah got the idea that God would forgive Nineveh?

> "And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. - Jonah 4:2

5. "God is love" (1 John 4:8). Notice it doesn't say "God is truth", or "God is power", or "God is wisdom". Love is another word for sacrafice, as something is only love if it costs you. Love requires you to give something up and that is God's chosen primary description (broken down into all it's parts in 1 Corinthians 13).
