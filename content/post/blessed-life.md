Have you ever considered that if Mary was the most blessed woman, and Jesus the most blessed man, what being "blessed" might look like for a Christian?

Neither Mary nor Jesus had an easy life.

At one point Mary has been shamed as immoral (who is Jesus father??), lost her husband, watched her firstborn son killed before her, probably low on money, and her family seems to have rejected her so John takes her in at Jesus request.

On the other hand, basically everyone abandoned, rejected, or hated Jesus and left him to die alone. Even his own family.

Ouch. Sign me up for the "blessed life now". Don't want to miss out on this.

> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. - Matthew 16:24-25

> If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? - Luke 14:26-28
