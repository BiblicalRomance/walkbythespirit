Notice that most of the major issues in America are caused by the desire for sex? Sexual desire and perversion has lead to issues of racism, abortion, riots, homosexuality, human trafficking and more. Let me explain.

# Homosexuality 

I've heard a lot of lesbian or transgender (but also gay) people share about the dad, cousin, uncle that molested them when they were younger. Girls decide to become men. Men decide they must be gay. Lots of combinations that stem from someone deciding to use/abuse them for sex. 

# Abortion

Guys get more sex without having to commit to anything. Pimps really value this. Women also need it because of the ways they are often abused.

# Racism and Riots

A number of black groups (and even more white groups) claim a number of causes have lead to modern racism. The major one they discount (that my black friends pointed out), is the lack of fathers caused by casual sex.

> "2010 study, 72 percent of black children are born to unwed mothers" - http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39993685/ns/health-womens_health/t/blacks-struggle-percent-unwed-mothers-rate/#.UhuxQWQ6UTg

No fathers. Bad fathers. Multiple fathers. Abusive fathers. All these have lead to really bad situations for youth. All these from the guy that just wanted to use the girl for his own pleasure.

Sex is everywhere and easily accessible. Lots of apps, clubs, districts, and porn. I mean, as a country we literally watch women raped in our best (highest rated) entertainment. No wonder we have red light districts, only so much the TV can do to feed your lust.

All this comes back to the fact there is harm to society in casual sex, but we're told to mind our own business.
