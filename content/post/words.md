I've found words mean really different things to the world and to God. Words are kind of empty without context which gives a word it's meaning; and us an understanding of it's usage. That is why the bible helps to renew our minds when we read it by teaching the correct views of love, fear, join, peace, and many other common words.

Let me give you an example of some words that don't mean the same things.

- [Love](/love-is)
- [Judgement](/judgement)
