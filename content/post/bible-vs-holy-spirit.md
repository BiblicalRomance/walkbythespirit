When I think about the Holy Spirit I first think of “the fruit of the Spirit”. But this is wrong. When we think about God we shouldn’t first think about what He gives us - but WHO He is. The Holy Spirit is God’s Spirit. Listening to and obeying the Spirit is listening and obeying God himself.

Remember all the things Jesus taught and did that aren’t written in the Bible? [John 12:49; 21:25] John says the world itself could not contain all that He did. The bible says that Jesus never said or did anything but what God told him. Since God was behind all His words and actions (which are not recorded in scripture), we can be sure there is more for God to say to us than only the general revelation of the bible to everyone.

The bible is a tool of the Spirit

1) The Bible was written by the Spirit [2 Peter 1:21, 2 Timothy 3:16-17].
2) The Bible is the sword of the Spirit [Ephesians 6:17]
3) The Spirit alone opens our eyes to scripture. [Matthew 16:17]
4) It is the Holy Spirit that leads us into all truth (John 16:13)
5) Our new life only should consist of following after the Spirit (Galatians 5:16)

The word of God isn’t just the bible - it is God himself. Hebrews 4:12 says

> “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do."

This is important because we only think “bible” when we hear the word of God. But everything is “naked and open unto the eyes” of the word of God. This is Jesus, God’s word. This same Jesus is the one that was directed in everything by the Father through His Spirit.

> Jesus said, “Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. - Matthew 12:31-32

What does it mean that it is greater wrong to blasphemy the Holy Spirit than Jesus? If the God’s Spirit is less important than the Bible, this wouldn’t make sense.

The bible is not more important than everything else Jesus or the Holy Spirit says. God’s word is always equally important even if it’s not printed in a book.

Don’t live with only half of God.

> “Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. - John 14:17
