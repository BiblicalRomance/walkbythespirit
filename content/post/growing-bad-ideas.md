title: Untold volumes of bad ideas
draft: true
---

When talking about the endtime, the first thing Jesus said was "Do not be deceived". Deception is easy enough to consider, but it takes some contemplation to realize what that means for us personally.

Have you ever considered that the number of bad ideas is going to be an order of magnitude worse than when Jesus was alive? We have over 7 billion people now. That is a lot of people, and each day more of them rise out of the world of agriculture and into the modern tech world.

More than ever, it seems there are millions and millions and millions of minds trying to understand the world and sharing those thoughts with others online. The number of new religions, worldviews, ideas, and solutions is massive and increasing every day as more combinations are formed.

We might be facing the same basic lies most of humanity has ("nothing new under the sun"), but in many new, more "reasonable" forms. We have untold numbers of new ways to package bad ideas so they look convincing, right, and good. Chances are pretty high there is a "version" of lies out there just for you.

It will fit with some of your ideas about the world and cause everything to make sense. You just need to be in the right situation / frame of mind.

> "And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. - Matthew 24:22-24
