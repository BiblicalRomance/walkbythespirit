title: Like Herod
---

I can relate with Herod. I like listening to good things even if I don't do them.

"For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly." - Mark 6:20

Like Herod, I gladly listen to stories, lessons, or teachings from good and loving men who live out truths God teaches. I like to think I wouldn't throw John under the bus like Herod did, but I'm sure there is some level of ignoring and even sacraficing I would do for my own purposes. 

For looks, for money, for progress, for safety, there's some point at which I would turn against them because it (seemingly) benifit me. An example of this might be Peter denying he knew Jesus out of fear of being kicked out or worse.

Notice, it's not the hearing that saves you - it's the doing.
