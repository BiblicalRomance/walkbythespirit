To the world, love means emotions and feelings. You can "fall into love" and you can "_fall out of love_". Love is a force you have no control over that simply provides pleasure.

God's description of love is that of many things (1 Corinthians 13) but especially sacrifice. You can't truly love something without giving something up for it (money, time, comfort). Love is costly: Just ask Jesus.

However, love is also something we make a choice to purse and something that follows us. God is love and we are made in his image. We never stop loving something, but what that something is will be determined by what we purse and spend time doing. Whatever you spend time doing is what you will value higher and love more.

> "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, your whole body shall be full of light. - Matthew 6:21-22

So to be really clear: what you spend time seeking is what you will love. If you want to love something, start putting your treasure into it (time, money, emotions).
