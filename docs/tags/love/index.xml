      <description>We all know that we need to speak truth and point our lies in a loving way. The most loving people also will seek to speak the truth for the purpose of restoring you (as God does) instead of punishing/removing you (as the world does).
The world is quick to execute or imprison people to remove evil as it has no reference for restoration or changing mans heart. However, Christians know the power of God to change man&#39;s heart.</description>

      <description>To the world, love means emotions and feelings. You can &amp;ldquo;fall into love&amp;rdquo; and you can &amp;ldquo;fall out of love&amp;quot;. Love is a force you have no control over that simply provides pleasure.
God&#39;s description of love is that of many things (1 Corinthians 13) but especially sacrifice. You can&#39;t truly love something without giving something up for it (money, time, comfort). Love is costly: Just ask Jesus.
However, love is also something we make a choice to purse and something that follows us.</description>
