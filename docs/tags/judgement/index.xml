      <description>We all know that we need to speak truth and point our lies in a loving way. The most loving people also will seek to speak the truth for the purpose of restoring you (as God does) instead of punishing/removing you (as the world does).
The world is quick to execute or imprison people to remove evil as it has no reference for restoration or changing mans heart. However, Christians know the power of God to change man&amp;rsquo;s heart.</description>
