      <title>Faith step 2</title>

      <description>God has saved us from fear and called us to walk in Faith. However, once you exercise your faith and receive the promise, the test starts over again. Faith for something requires new faith once you have obtained to continue moving forward. God is a relational God - not a prize/checklist God.
One of the most incredible stories of faith is actually found in Abraham. God called him away to leave his family and journey to someplace he did not even know (God would was leading him).</description>

      <title>Train up an Employee</title>

      <description>There is a famous verse in Proverbs 22:6 about raising children. One aspect of this verse was explained to me in the context of employee&#39;s the other day.
 &amp;ldquo;Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.&amp;rdquo; - Proverbs 22:6
 The part I want to focus on is &amp;ldquo;the way he should go&amp;rdquo;. Notice it doesn&#39;t say &amp;ldquo;the way you are going&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Judging Others</title>

      <description>We all know that we need to speak truth and point our lies in a loving way. The most loving people also will seek to speak the truth for the purpose of restoring you (as God does) instead of punishing/removing you (as the world does).
The world is quick to execute or imprison people to remove evil as it has no reference for restoration or changing mans heart. However, Christians know the power of God to change man&#39;s heart.</description>

      <title>Love Is</title>

      <description>To the world, love means emotions and feelings. You can &amp;ldquo;fall into love&amp;rdquo; and you can &amp;ldquo;fall out of love&amp;quot;. Love is a force you have no control over that simply provides pleasure.
God&#39;s description of love is that of many things (1 Corinthians 13) but especially sacrifice. You can&#39;t truly love something without giving something up for it (money, time, comfort). Love is costly: Just ask Jesus.
However, love is also something we make a choice to purse and something that follows us.</description>

      <title>A Promised Land</title>

      <description>“Thomas said to him, Lord, we do not know where you go; how can we know the way? Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. - John 14:5-6
 The pattern we see in scripture is one of God leading those who have faith in God. Every important event in scripture is 100% God leading people who seem at best to have no more than a fuzzy idea about where they are even going.</description>

      <title>Jesus is our Example</title>

      <description>If we want to imitate Christ then we have to deny ourselves, take up the cross, and follow him. Perhaps you agree with this, but it means an end to your plans and your choices forever. It means learning how to walk by the Spirit. Never again to walk by the flesh.
Jesus is our example in all things. He never said or did anything but what God told him.</description>

      <title>Knowing God&#39;s Spirit</title>

      <description>In John 14 Jesus tells his disciples that we are to know the Holy Spirit
 “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. - John 14:16-17</description>

      <title>The Bible is not more important than the Holy Spirit</title>
      <link>http://walkbythespirit.org/post/bible-vs-holy-spirit/</link>

      <description>When I think about the Holy Spirit I first think of “the fruit of the Spirit”. But this is wrong. When we think about God we shouldn’t first think about what He gives us - but WHO He is. The Holy Spirit is God’s Spirit. Listening to and obeying the Spirit is listening and obeying God himself.
Remember all the things Jesus taught and did that aren’t written in the Bible?</description>

      <title>The Spirit Leads Us Into All Truth</title>

      <description>Every prophet in the Old and New Testament, every new truth and turn of the church (from salvation for the gentiles to the missionary journeys), and every important thing period in the bible started with God’s word and leading.
Let&#39;s take the salvation of the Gentiles. Despite the prophecies in every book of the bible about their salvation, God gave specific revelation to the early church by His Spirit, that the Gentiles would also share in salvation.</description>

      <title>Looking Forward To</title>

      <description>It&#39;s Christmas time again. Everyone has their heart set on at least one food, activity, or person they can&#39;t wait to enjoy time with. As humans, we&#39;re &amp;ldquo;professional wanters&amp;rdquo; - there is always something we want and often look forward too. For most of us it&#39;s a daily thing and we use it as some kind of crutch to cope with things.
Our flesh has desires.
Not only are we waiting to satisfy ourselves with some big goal (vacation, new house, marriage, etc&amp;hellip;), but we also fill our desires with little things constantly.</description>

      <title>The blessed life</title>
      <link>http://walkbythespirit.org/post/blessed-life/</link>

      <description>Have you ever considered that if Mary was the most blessed woman, and Jesus the most blessed man, what being &amp;ldquo;blessed&amp;rdquo; might look like for a Christian?
Neither Mary nor Jesus had an easy life.
At one point Mary has been shamed as immoral (who is Jesus father??), lost her husband, watched her firstborn son killed before her, probably low on money, and her family seems to have rejected her so John takes her in at Jesus request.</description>

      <title>We Love Our Sin</title>

      <description>As much as people like to pretend &amp;ldquo;Science vs Scripture&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Logic vs Faith&amp;rdquo; many of our choices are not really about that. Very often you will find the most important ideas and desires of humans have no root in logic or science - but in our own desires. Consider the story about Stephen.
&amp;ldquo;And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.</description>
