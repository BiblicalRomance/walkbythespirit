        <p>There is a famous verse in Proverbs 22:6 about raising children. One aspect of this verse was explained to me in the context of employee's the other day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.&rdquo; - Proverbs 22:6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The part I want to focus on is &ldquo;the way he should go&rdquo;. Notice it doesn't say &ldquo;the way you are going&rdquo;. We don't train our children to be little personal replicas of our life and thoughts. God created them unique for the plans and purposes he has for them. We are to train our kids up in the way &ldquo;he should go&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This applies to employees, students, and anyone under our authority. It's our goal to help train them for the path and plan God has for them. If someone feels God is leading them to go serve somewhere else, we shouldn't be focused on our loss. We should consider their path as valuable as ours and (like Jesus) seek to serve them.</p>
