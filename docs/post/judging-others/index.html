        <p>We all know that we need to speak truth and point our lies in a loving way. The most loving people also will seek to speak the truth for the purpose of restoring you (as God does) instead of punishing/removing you (as the world does).</p>
<p>The world is quick to execute or imprison people to remove evil as it has no reference for restoration or changing mans heart. However, Christians know the power of God to change man's heart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Judge not, that ye be not judged.&rdquo; - Matthew 7:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People often get confused by the phrase &ldquo;Judge not&rdquo; and forget that God actually calls Christians to judge within the church. It's not the world's kind of judgement though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not you judge them that are within? But them that are without God judges. - 1 Corinthians 5:12-13</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do we need to judge church members? To assess the issue and restore them. We need to warn and help them out of sin. So why do we not judge the world? Because they are not our responsibility, they do not have God's Spirit inside them nor can we &ldquo;restore&rdquo; them.</p>
