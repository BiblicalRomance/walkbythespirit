<p>&ldquo;For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.&rdquo; - Mark 6:20</p>
<p>Like Herod, I gladly listen to stories, lessons, or teachings from good and loving men who live out truths God teaches. I like to think I wouldn't throw John under the bus like Herod did, but I'm sure there is some level of ignoring and even sacraficing I would do for my own purposes.</p>
<p>For looks, for money, for progress, for safety, there's some point at which I would turn against them because it (seemingly) benifit me. An example of this might be Peter denying he knew Jesus out of fear of being kicked out or worse.</p>
<p>Notice, it's not the hearing that saves you - it's the doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore whosoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock&rdquo; - Matthew 7:24</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.&rdquo; - Luke 11:28</p>
