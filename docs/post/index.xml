      <description>“Thomas said to him, Lord, we do not know where you go; how can we know the way? Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. - John 14:5-6
 The pattern we see in scripture is one of God leading those who have faith in God. Every important event in scripture is 100% God leading people who seem at best to have no more than a fuzzy idea about where they are even going.</description>

      <description>If we want to imitate Christ then we have to deny ourselves, take up the cross, and follow him. Perhaps you agree with this, but it means an end to your plans and your choices forever. It means learning how to walk by the Spirit. Never again to walk by the flesh.
Jesus is our example in all things. He never said or did anything but what God told him.</description>

      <description>In John 14 Jesus tells his disciples that we are to know the Holy Spirit
 “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. - John 14:16-17</description>

      <title>The Bible is not more important than the Holy Spirit</title>

      <description>When I think about the Holy Spirit I first think of “the fruit of the Spirit”. But this is wrong. When we think about God we shouldn’t first think about what He gives us - but WHO He is. The Holy Spirit is God’s Spirit. Listening to and obeying the Spirit is listening and obeying God himself.
Remember all the things Jesus taught and did that aren’t written in the Bible?</description>

      <description>Every prophet in the Old and New Testament, every new truth and turn of the church (from salvation for the gentiles to the missionary journeys), and every important thing period in the bible started with God’s word and leading.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take the salvation of the Gentiles. Despite the prophecies in every book of the bible about their salvation, God gave specific revelation to the early church by His Spirit, that the Gentiles would also share in salvation.</description>
