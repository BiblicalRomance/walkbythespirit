        <p>As much as people like to pretend &ldquo;Science vs Scripture&rdquo; or &ldquo;Logic vs Faith&rdquo; many of our choices are not really about that. Very often you will find the most important ideas and desires of humans have no root in logic or science - but in our own desires. Consider the story about Stephen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. - Acts 6:1-3</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost&hellip; &hellip;And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people&hellip; &hellip;And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. - Acts 6:5-10</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council&hellip; &hellip;And fixing their gaze on him, all who were sitting in the Council saw his face like the face of an angel. - Acts 6:12-15</p>
<p>&hellip; and they still killed him.</p>
<p>Even if someone gives perfect answers that can't be argued against, they receive supernatural power to do miracles, and all their <em>critics</em> (not followers) think they literally look like an angel - that still isn't enough. They wanted this random person dead they were so mad.</p>
<p>We really love our sin. Reason be dammed.</p>
